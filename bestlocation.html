        Jaipur derives its name from Sawai Jai Singh II (1693-1744), the ruler of Amer, who founded the city in 1727. In Sanskrit, variations of the word "pur" or "pura" are commonly used to refer to a city or town with "Jaipur" essentially meaning "The City of Jai" or "Jai's City," paying homage to Maharaja Jai Singh II, who established the city.
        Jaipur is a popular tourist destination in India, forming a part of the west Golden triangle tourist circuit along with Delhi and Agra. The city serves as a gateway to other tourist destinations in Rajasthan like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Udaipur, Kota, Mount Abu and has two World heritage sites of Amer Fort and Jantar Mantar. On 6 July 2019, the city was named to the World Heritage Cities list. It is also known as Paris of India. Due to its beauty C.V. Raman called it "Island of Glory".

        Udaipur was founded in 1559, by Maharana Udai Singh II in the fertile circular Girwa Valley to the southwest of Nagda, on the Banas River. The city was established as the new capital of the Mewar kingdom.The city is located in the southernmost part of Rajasthan, near the Gujarat border. It is surrounded by the Aravali Range, which separates it from the Thar Desert. It is placed close to the median point between two major Indian metro cities, around 660 km from Delhi and 800 km from Mumbai. Besides, connectivity with Gujarat ports provide Udaipur a strategic geographical advantage. Udaipur is well connected with nearby cities and states by means of road, rail and air transportation facilities. The city is served by the Maharana Pratap Airport. Common languages spoken include Hindi, English and Rajasthani (Mewari).

    <h2 align="left">JODHPUR</h2> <img src="bestlocation 3.jpg" alt="">

    <p align="left">
        Jodhpur city was founded in 1459 by Rao Jodha Rathore. Jodha succeeded in conquering the surrounding territory from the Delhi Sultanate and thus founded a kingdom that came to be known as Marwar. As Jodha hailed from the nearby town of Mandore, that town initially served as the capital of this state; however, Jodhpur soon took over that role, even during the lifetime of Jodha. The city was located on the strategic road linking Delhi to Gujarat. This enabled it to profit from a flourishing trade in opium, copper, silk, sandalwood, dates, and other tradeable goods.
        Jodhpur is a famous tourist spot with a palace, fort, and temples, set in the stark landscape of the Thar Desert. It's also known as the Blue City due to the dominant color scheme of its buildings in old town. The old city circles the Mehrangarh Fort and is bounded by a wall with several gates. Jodhpur lies near the geographic centre of the Rajasthan state, which makes it a convenient base for travel in a region much frequented by tourists.

    <h2 align="left">BIKANER</h2> <img src="bestlocation 4.jpg" alt="">
    <br>
    <p align="left">
        Rao Bika established the city of Bikaner in 1488. He was the first son of Maharaja Rao Jodha of the Rathore clan, the founder of Jodhpur and conquered the largely arid country in the north of Rajasthan. As the first son of Jodha he wanted to have his own kingdom, not inheriting Jodhpur from his father or the title of Maharaja. He therefore decided to build his own kingdom in what is now the state of Bikaner, in the area of Jangladesh.
        The Karni Mata (करणी माता) Temple or the Rat Temple of Rajasthan is situated around 30 km away from the Bikaner city and is dedicated to goddess Karni Mata, a famous mystic of her times, believed to be an incarnation of goddess Durga. The locals will be quick to point out that the creatures running around in the temple are not rats, they are kaaba. Kaabas are believed to be reincarnations of humans who had been devotees of Karni Mata, and the brevity of human life did not sufficiently satisfy their devotion.
